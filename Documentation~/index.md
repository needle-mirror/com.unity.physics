Introduction to Unity Physics
======

Unity Physics is a deterministic rigid body dynamics system and spatial query system written from the ground up using the Unity data oriented tech stack. Unity Physics originates from a close collaboration between Unity and the Havok Physics team at Microsoft.  

## About these documents

These are very early stage documents which will be extended over time. Please read through the Design Philosophy and Getting Started at least, which should give you an good overview of how to use the physics system at a high level. As the code settles down we will add more explanation on how to modify the simulation and expand on how the algorithms work. The most up to date use of Unity Physics is the Samples for it in the main DOTs sample repository and they cover a wide range of use cases not yet covered in these documents, such as  character controllers, ray cast driven cars, and examples of all the joints.
