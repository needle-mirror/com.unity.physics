# The Physics Step authoring component

To control Unity Physics settings, you need a `Physics Step` authoring component. As usual when working with **Entities**, a **SubScene** is necessary when adding the `Physics Step` authoring component. Only one instance of this component should be present in a scene as it will apply to the whole physics simulation.

This component allows configuring various aspects of the simulation via the following fields.

| Field                               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| Simulation Type                     | Select between **Unity Physics**, **Havok Physics** or **None** as physics engine.

| Gravity                             | Set the global gravity applied to all dynamic rigid bodies in the physics world.<br>Note that you can use the **PhysicsGravityFactor** ECS data component to modify the gravity applied to individual rigid bodies, as a multiple of the global gravity specified here.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Substep Count                       | Specify the number of substep iterations the physics system performs. The duration of a substep is equal to the physics frame time divided by the number of substep iterations. Therefore, higher values mean smaller timesteps will be taken per frame. This can be more stable up to a point where the timestep becomes so small that computational numerical errors can be introduced. Higher values may provide higher accuracy and stability when solving constraints, but can reduce simulation performance. In each substep, the solver will use **Solver Iteration Count** many iterations to compute the joint and contact forces. This option is only considered when **Unity Physics** is chosen as **Simulation Type**. |
| Solver Iteration Count              | Specify the number of solver iterations the physics system performs to correct contact penetrations and joint errors. Higher values provide higher accuracy and stability, but can reduce simulation performance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Multi Threaded                      | Enable multi-threading.<br>If enabled, the physics system maximizes the number of threads used for calculating the simulation results. If disabled, the physics system reduces the number of utilized threads to a minimum, performing most operations in a single thread.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Collision Tolerance                 | Set the collision tolerance.<br> The collision tolerance specifies the minimum distance required for contacts between rigid bodies to be created. This value can be increased if undesired collision tunneling is observed in the simulation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Incremental Dynamic Broadphase      | Enable the incremental dynamic broadphase.<br>Enabling this option will update the dynamic broadphase incrementally whenever changes between simulation steps occur, potentially leading to time savings for cases with many dynamic rigid bodies that don't move or otherwise change.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| Enable Contact Solver Stabilization Heuristic | Enabling the contact solver stabilization heuristic results in better simulation stability when stacking objects with low solver iteration counts, by preventing undesired sliding artifacts. However, it can reduce simulation performance and produce unplausible results in certain physical interactions involving friction forces.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
