| [Ghost collisions](ghost-collisions.md) are generated by the collision detection. | Ghost collisions can be caused by the Unity Physics continuous collision detection method, particularly when dealing with fast moving objects, small colliders, or small triangles. Try [modifying or filtering](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/EntityComponentSystemSamples/blob/master/PhysicsSamples/Assets/9.%20Modify/Scripts/ModifyNarrowphaseContactsBehaviour.cs) the undesired collisions as demonstrated in the "Modify - Narrowphase Contacts.unity" sample scene in the [PhysicsSamples](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/EntityComponentSystemSamples/tree/master/PhysicsSamples/) project. |
| When moving a static rigid body that has a [`Parent`](xref:Unity.Transforms.Parent), its new location is not considered in the collision detection or in collision queries. | This issue can be caused by the body's [`LocalToWorld`](xref:Unity.Transforms.LocalToWorld) component being out of date. Make sure it is up-to-date before the physics systems are run. See [Static Bodies and Parents](concepts-data.md#static-bodies-and-parents) for a detailed explanation of this issue and additional recommendations. |
