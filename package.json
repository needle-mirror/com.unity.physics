Both the joint force values and the constraint relaxation parameters are set to the appropriate values in the underlying engine and the Unity Physics simulation behavior now closely matches the behavior in built-in physics.\n* Fixed a case that could lead to invalid data in the impulse handling within the LinearLimitJacobian\n* Limits in Hinge Joint authoring components, enabled via the \"Use Limits\" option, are now respected when the \"Use Spring\" option is also enabled."
