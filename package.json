The default value has been changed to a smaller, more performant value of 0.01 meters. If you observe any tunneling issues in your use case, please increase the value via the `PhysicsStepAuthoring` component.\n\n### Changed\n\n* Updated Burst dependency to version 1.8.16\n\n### Fixed\n\n* Prevent `Entity.Null` entries in the `PhysicsColliderKeyEntityPair` buffer of rigid body entities with compound colliders."
